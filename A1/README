For this assignment, I wrote OpenGL code that draws a flat shaded triangle and
square, and a multicolored circle.

I used two seperate shaders and VAOs, one for drawing the flat colors through a
uniform and one for allowing color vertex info to be passed in.

I'm building for Linux and using CMake for project configuration, but running the build.sh script in
the A1 directory should build everything and put a Main executable in that
directory.  I have tested that this works on tux, but for convenience I am
including the pre-built Main binary so you can just run it.
