In this assignment, I did the following:

- Place a textured cube and a recursively built sphere on a textured ground
  plane, and surround by a textured skybox

- All objects are lit

- All A5 features


All controls are as specified in the assignment description.

I have an included a precompiled MAC binary called Main in the A6 directory that you
can run from the terminal on a Mac.  Clicking it won't work.

$ cd A6
$ ./Main

NOTE: You may have to set the binary's execute bit first by running

$ chmod +x Main

To build, if desired, simply run

$ ./build.sh 

in the A6/ directory.  ( You may need to set its execute bit as well).


To build for Mac (this is actually what I developed it on),
you will probably need to install some packages with brew.  You should be able
to build with Xcode, but I haven't tested this.  I recommend just running the
binary.
