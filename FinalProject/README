Still needs doing:

Convert cube textures to use a cube map (like the skybox), and pass a texture
name to the constructor

All other project stuff


What works now:

Planes and cubes with textures from A6

Everything else from A6

Picking (calls object's wasPicked() method)

Objects "die" and are removed from the scene when picked
